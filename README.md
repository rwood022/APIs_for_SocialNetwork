## Description
The complexity of building, planning ,and creating a social networking application  demostrates a 'full-circle' understanding of web development. I was motivated to create this project because I wanted to understand the structure/development of building the API routes for a social network application.

My goal was to showcase the concepts I've learned so far as a new web developer.
I have learned how to connect api routes for a social network application.
